Regenerating files for existing project data_selector
No actions specified on command line;
creating qflow script file /home/du/Files_du/UCR/II_18/MicroE/PROYECTO/411-proyecto/Qflow/qflow_exec.sh only.
Uncomment lines in this file and source the file to run the flow.
Running blif2cel.tcl
Running decongest to set initial density of 0.8
Reading FILL macros from LEF file.

decongest.tcl:
Fixed density planning, density = 0.8
Number of cells = 9171, total width = 3066240
Width of fill = 80, total fill cells added = 9582

Done!
First attempt routing succeeded;  final placement iteration is unnecessary.
